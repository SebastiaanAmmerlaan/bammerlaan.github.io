# bammerlaan.github.io
Personal website of classical baritone Sebastiaan Ammerlaan
Based on the [Scribble theme](https://github.com/muan/scribble). 

Other code sources glued together in a Frankensteinesque manner:

- [This blog post](https://forestry.io/blog/creating-a-multilingual-blog-with-jekyll/) for the bilingual part of the site
- [Staticman v3](https://git.io/smdemo) for comments 
- [This blog post](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/) for a pluginless method to get blog tags (doesn't work too well with the bilingual part but I can live with that)
- A navigation bar built with [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) using [this](https://codepen.io/YoungElPaso/pen/geqpad) Codepen snippet. 

Site uses as little Javascript as possible, mostly HTML and CSS using [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/).
