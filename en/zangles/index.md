Singing is the instrument with the shortest distance between you and the music. It allows you to create music exactly how you imagine it: a direct translation of your musical vision. There is no instrument between you and your music: you need only depend on yourself.

Still, what you sing doesn't always sound like how you would like. You may have difficulty producing certain high or low notes, you may have a hard time finding the right *sound*, or perhaps you have simply never sung before and don't know where to start.

Together we will work on having the music sound like you want. My focus will always be on a healthy way of using your voice and together we can work on your vocal technique.


## The singing lessons

My own background is in classical voice training, and this is also the method I use during my singing lessons. This does not mean I cannot help you with other genres like musical, pop or jazz: the classical method is an excellent starting point for all kinds of singing.

A try-out lesson is always free. During this lesson we will look at what you are hoping to achieve and how I can help you with that. It helps if you bring something along to sing! 

I teach in Utrecht, either at my house in Zuilen or at the Conservatory of Utrecht. If desired I can also teach on location.
